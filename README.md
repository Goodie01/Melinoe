# Melinoe
![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/Goodie01/Melinoe/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

The goal is to provide a testing framework that can cover testing all aspects of a application in a similar method, that can have new components added to it as needed. This could, eventually, extend as far as testing a thick GUI Client.

MelinoÃ« is a chthonic nymph or goddess invoked in one of the Orphic Hymns and represented as a bringer of nightmares and madness. This seems particularly suitable for a testing framework.

## Goals and points of difference

In my time I've seen many automation frameworks. I have found that many of them focused on making the inputs as easy to read and digestible as possible. Often leaning in to such paradigms as BDD.

Often this would follow a workflow where testers would write a BDD statement, which developers would then ensure connects to the correct code in the backend. In theory this means that developers only have to fill in the new blocks, and allows for code re-usability and for testers to know what the test was doing. In practice I often found that the testers BDD statements were often written in such a way as to often need new code, and re-usability was often a afterthought.

In other words I often found this liken to wringing blood from a stone. In my experience the most successful test framework I used was one that focused on making the output as digestible as possible. 

With this framework, and workflow testers describe what they want the tests to do in whatever method they want, developers are free to write code to do this as they like, and the output is readable by developers, testers, and others involved in the project as required.



## Compile and run examples

Requires
* Java 21
* Maven 3.5.0+
* Create a default.properties file in /examples/src/main/resources/default.properties
  * Retry timeouts at a later date will be moved to being overrides instead of requirements 
  * Only firefox is currently supported
  * The exe location should be correct for your machine

```properties
RETRY_COUNT=5
RETRY_SLEEP_TIME_MS=100
BROWSER=FIREFOX
BROWSER_EXE_LOCATION=C:\\Program Files\\Firefox Nightly\\firefox.exe
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Goodie01/Melinoe.git
cd Melinoe
mvn clean install -f framework/pom.xml && mvn clean test -f examples/pom.xml
```

## Goals
1. Test a web application
1. Test a REST api
1. Test that when you perform a action via a rest API or UI, a outgoing request is made
1. Detailed logs of all success and failures can be seen after a run

## Melinoe is being created in at multiphased approach phases
1. Create framework
   1. Selenium based web testing
   1. Testing a rest API
1. Think through testing outgoing API requests

## Componets
1. Test library, intended as a java library to be pulled in instead of JUnit, to write intergration tests
1. Logs reading UI
1. Outgoing Rest API proxy (This needs a succinct name)
